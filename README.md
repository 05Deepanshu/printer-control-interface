- PyQt6

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/printer-control-gui.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd printer-control-interface
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv printer_env
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `printer_env\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS and Linux: `source printer_env/bin/activate`
5. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the application:
```
python printer_control_gui.py
```

## Note

This is a mock implementation. In a real-world scenario, you would need to replace the mock API functions with actual API calls to interact with printer hardware.
